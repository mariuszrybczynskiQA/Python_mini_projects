# Python_mini_projects
 Python mini projects.
 
My journey as Quality Assurance Engineer started on June 2022, since then i've been expanding my skill set, i'm aiming to be an automation tester (prefferably in python but switching to other language shouldn't be a problem)
I'm currently learning Python, selenium and Django.
You can find several of my projects here.
